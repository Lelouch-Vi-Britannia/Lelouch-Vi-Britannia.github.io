    <p>
        I graduated from Miami University in 2019 with a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering and am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Science at Boston University. I have four years of work experience in the manufacturing industry, where I honed my skills in product management and project management. I am fluent in three languages: Mandarin, English, and Japanese.

        My personal motto is, "Genius is eternal patience." I have a deep passion for anime and gaming, having watched most of the popular Japanese anime series and played a wide variety of games. In 2018, I was ranked 700 on the US server for Dota 2. My favorite anime is <em>Code Geass</em>.

        Currently, my research focuses on robotics and reinforcement learning. I believe these technologies have the potential to significantly improve product efficiency. As demonstrated by OpenAIâ€™s models like Dota 2's <em>OpenAI Five</em>, <em>AlphaGo</em>, and <em>AlphaStar</em> for Starcraft, reinforcement learning can lead to the creation of algorithms that surpass human performance in complex tasks and games.
