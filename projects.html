<h1>Projects</h1>

<h2>Drone (2018)</h2>
<p>
    In 2018, I built a drone from scratch using a Raspberry Pi and C programming. This project involved designing the control system, integrating sensors for flight stability, and programming the navigation algorithms. The drone could be remotely controlled and featured basic obstacle avoidance, showcasing my skills in embedded systems and software development.

<h2>Musical Tesla Coil (2020)</h2>
<p>
    In 2020, I created a musical Tesla coil capable of producing music by modulating electrical discharges. The project required designing the coil, building the circuits, and developing software to control the sound frequency. The result was a working Tesla coil that could play music through electrical arcs, combining my interests in physics, electronics, and programming.

<h2>AI for Gaming (In Progress)</h2>
<p>
    Currently, I am developing an AI that utilizes reinforcement learning and image recognition to play two complex games: <em>Monster Hunter</em> and <em>Black Myth Wukong</em>. This project involves training the AI to recognize in-game objects, make decisions, and adapt strategies in real-time. My goal is to create an AI that can not only compete with human players but potentially outperform them by learning from experience.
