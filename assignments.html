<h2>Assignment 1: Data Collection and Analysis</h2>
<p>
    <strong>Approach:</strong> I first created few graphs and made a pridiction of the ideal location based on observation. From the observation I also noticed that some data are recorded at wrong time period so I handled it late in the project. After that, I performed the computation and the result aligned with my prediction.

<h2>Assignment 3: Singular Value Decomposition</h2>
<p>
    <strong>Approach:</strong> This assignment involved reducing the dimensionality of the MNIST dataset using SVD and analyzing its effect on logistic regression performance. We computed SVD with varying components, trained logistic regression models, and compared accuracy and training times to understand the trade-offs between model complexity and performance.
