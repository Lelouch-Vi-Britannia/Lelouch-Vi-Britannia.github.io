<h1>Work Experience</h1>

<h2>ET Technology Wuxi Co., Ltd (2019 - 2023)</h2>
<p><strong>Product Manager & Project Manager</strong></p>

<p>
    During my time at ET Technology Wuxi Co., Ltd, I held dual roles as a Product Manager and Project Manager. I was responsible for overseeing the entire product development lifecycle, from initial concept to final delivery, while ensuring project timelines and quality standards were met.
</p>

<h3>Key Challenges and Solutions</h3>
<p>
    One of the biggest challenges I faced was building the servo drive system from scratch, a completely new venture for both the company and the industry. At the outset, no one on the engineering team had in-depth knowledge of servo drive technology. In the market, very few suppliers were capable of developing their own servo drives, and most were reluctant to share their source code. Additionally, the high cost of traditional servo drive designs made using off-the-shelf solutions impractical.
</p>
<p>
    To overcome these obstacles, we spent over a month identifying suppliers with the ability to develop custom servo drives. We eventually negotiated a technical transfer agreement that provided the knowledge we needed. Another challenge arose from safety requirements: industrial doors need a manual operating lever, but in our servo design, the space for this lever was occupied by the encoder, a key component of the servo system. Without solving this, the product couldn’t be launched.
</p>
<p>
    Through extensive collaboration with motor, encoder, and drive suppliers, as well as our internal engineering team, we developed a new encoder design that allowed space for the manual lever. We also worked closely with suppliers to optimize the servo drive’s cost structure, reducing the overall cost by 30% compared to traditional frequency drive systems. This breakthrough made the servo door operator not only cost-effective but also highly functional.
</p>

<h3>Collaboration with Other Departments</h3>
<p>
    Collaboration was key to the success of this project. I facilitated weekly meetings with the engineering team to track development progress and ensure that the product met all technical requirements. I worked closely with the marketing department to effectively communicate the product’s unique features in promotional materials. Additionally, I coordinated with the sales team to gather customer feedback and incorporated those insights into the product design. By keeping all departments aligned and informed, we were able to launch the product on schedule with strong internal support.
</p>

<h3>Customer Feedback and Market Impact</h3>
<p>
    When clients first saw the servo industrial door operator at trade shows, they were highly impressed, especially after learning about its performance and competitive pricing. In the first year, we secured orders from three of Europe’s largest door manufacturing companies, and we also began discussions with several North American companies. This product even helped us break into the Japanese market, where it was described as revolutionary due to its innovative design and cost-effectiveness.
</p>
<p>
    The overwhelming positive feedback from customers significantly influenced our company’s strategy. Traditionally, we operated as an OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer), but many clients encouraged us to establish our own manufacturing facilities and launch our own brand. Their enthusiasm not only validated the product but also opened new opportunities for brand expansion and direct market engagement, marking a pivotal moment for the company’s growth.
